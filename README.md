# Exoplanet Indexer

Welcome to Exoplanet Indexer, the new app to track all of the latest discoveries in astronomy.  This app provides an easy way to add planets and catalog entire star systems, including key metrics for the planet and its star.  In the interest of collaboration, all users can view all astronomical data in the system, but secure user accounts ensure that your own data stays the way you want it.  This tool uses collaboration to create an important index of all new discoveries.
